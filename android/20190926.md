# Dialog vs DialogFragment

Dialog : A dialog is a small window that prompts the user to make a decision or enter additional information. A dialog does not fill the screen and is normally used for [modal](https://github.com/sc545/TIL/blob/master/etc/20190926.md) events that require users to take an action before they can proceed.

DialogFragment : A fragment that displays a dialog window, floating on top of its activity's window. This fragment contains a Dialog object, which it displays as appropriate based on the fragment's state. Control of the dialog (deciding when to show, hide, dismiss it) should be done through the API here, not with direct calls on the dialog.
